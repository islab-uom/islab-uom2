- title: "Mapping local heterogeneity in open twisted bilayer graphene devices"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.
